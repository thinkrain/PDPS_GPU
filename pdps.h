/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Invalid command-line argument

One or more command-line arguments is invalid.  Check the syntax of
the command you are using to launch LAMMPS.

E: Cannot use -reorder after -partition

Self-explanatory.  See doc page discussion of command-line switches.

E: Processor partitions are inconsistent

The total number of processors in all partitions must match the number
of processors LAMMPS is running on.

E: Must use -in switch with multiple partitions

A multi-partition simulation cannot read the input script from stdin.
The -in command-line option must be used to specify a file.

E: Can only use -pscreen with multiple partitions

Self-explanatory.  See doc page discussion of command-line switches.

E: Can only use -plog with multiple partitions

Self-explanatory.  See doc page discussion of command-line switches.

E: Cannot open universe screen file

For a multi-partition run, the master screen file cannot be opened.
Check that the directory you are running in allows for files to be
created.

E: Cannot open log.lammps

The default LAMMPS log file cannot be opened.  Check that the
directory you are running in allows for files to be created.

E: Cannot open universe log file

For a multi-partition run, the master log file cannot be opened.
Check that the directory you are running in allows for files to be
created.

E: Cannot open input script %s

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot open screen file

The screen file specified as a command-line argument cannot be
opened.  Check that the directory you are running in allows for files
to be created.

E: Cannot open logfile

The LAMMPS log file named in a command-line argument cannot be opened.
Check that the path and name are correct.

E: Smallint setting in lmptype.h is invalid

It has to be the size of an integer.

E: Tagint setting in lmptype.h is invalid

Tagint must be as large or larger than smallint.

E: Bigint setting in lmptype.h is invalid

Size of bigint is less than size of tagint.

E: MPI_LMP_TAGINT and tagint in lmptype.h are not compatible

The size of the MPI datatype does not match the size of a tagint.

E: MPI_LMP_BIGINT and bigint in lmptype.h are not compatible

The size of the MPI datatype does not match the size of a bigint.

E: Small, tag, big integers are not sized correctly

See description of these 3 data types in src/lmptype.h.

E: 64-bit atom IDs are not yet supported

See description of this data type in src/lmptype.h.

E: Cannot use -cuda on without USER-CUDA installed

The USER-CUDA package must be installed via "make yes-user-cuda"
before LAMMPS is built.
